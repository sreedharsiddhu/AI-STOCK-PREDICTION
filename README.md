# AI-STOCK-PREDICTION
AI Stock Prediction Using Live API from Alpha Vantage
This project is an AI-powered stock price prediction system that leverages machine learning models and live stock market data from the Alpha Vantage API. The system is designed to predict future stock prices based on historical data, technical indicators, and real-time market trends.

Features
Live Data Integration: Fetches real-time and historical stock data using the Alpha Vantage API.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, or Linear Regression) for accurate stock price prediction.

Technical Indicators: Incorporates key technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI) to enhance prediction accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input stock symbols and view predictions.

Visualization: Generates interactive charts and graphs to visualize historical data and predicted trends.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and model training.

Alpha Vantage API: Source of real-time and historical stock data.

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models (e.g., LSTM).

Pandas/Numpy: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Plotly: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For implementing traditional machine learning models.

How It Works
Data Collection: The system fetches historical and real-time stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training: Machine learning models are trained on historical data to learn patterns and trends.

Prediction: The trained models predict future stock prices based on the latest data.

Visualization: Results are displayed in interactive charts for easy interpretation.
